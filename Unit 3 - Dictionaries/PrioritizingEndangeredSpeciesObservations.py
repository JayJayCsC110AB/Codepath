"""
In your work with a wildlife conservation database, you have two lists: 
observed_species and priority_species. The elements of priority_species are distinct,
and all elements in priority_species are also in observed_species.

Write a function prioritize_observations() that sorts the elements of observed_species such that the relative ordering of items in observed_species matches that of priority_species. Species that do not appear in priority_species should be placed at the end of observed_species in ascending order.



Expected Output:

["🐯", "🐯", "🐯", "🦌", "🐘", "🦁", "🦁", "🐍", "🐻", "🐼", "🦑"]
["cardinal", "sparrow", "bluejay", "crow", "robin"]
